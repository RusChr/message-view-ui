# üìö Code Samples

### Activity 
Presents message with an activity indicator view. The intention behind this presentation is to report some long running task:

```swift
MessageView.showActivity(withMessage: "Please wait...", dismissAfter: 3.0)
```

Or you can omit the `dismissAfter` parameter and hide the `MessageView` manually by calling `hide` method:

```swift
MessageView.hide()
```

### Success
Presents a success message. The intention behind this presentation is to report that something was successful or completed:

```swift
MessageView.showSuccess(withMessage: "Success!", dismissAfter: 2.25)
```

### Warning
Presents a warning message. The intention behind this presentation is to report that something wasn't successful or failed:

```swift
MessageView.showWarning(withMessage: "Warning!", dismissAfter: 2.5)
```

### Custom
Presents a custom image above the message. The intention behind this presentation style is defined by you, the developer. For instance we can present a failure `MessageView` by providing `failureImage` and the corresponding `tintColor`:

```swift
MessageView.showCustom(image: failureImage,
                              tintColor: .red,
                              withMessage: "Something went wrong",
                              dismissAfter: 2.8)
```

### Message update
Message updates are used in order to refresh the text message inside a `MessageView` while it's presented on screen. It's useful is situations when a long running task is in progress and we need to report various stages of the progress:

```swift
MessageView.showActivity(withMessage: ‚ÄúInitializing the task...")

fetcher.fetch(data) { result in 
  MessageView.update(message: "Completed! Result is \(result)", dismissAfter: 3.0)
  handle(result)
}.progress { value in 
  MessageView.update(message: "Fetching: \(value)%")
}
```

### Styles
There is a protocol called `MessageViewBuilder` that defines a number of properties. By creating your own version of style or by using one of the existing styles, you can customize the visuals of the component:

```swift
MessageView.configure(with: .dark)
MessageView.configure(with: .extraLight)
MessageView.configure(with: .default)
```

Or you can use an alternative `configure` method with your own version of style type:

```swift
public struct MessageViewNightStyleBuilder: MessageViewBuilder {
    public var activityIndicatorColor: UIColor                          = .init(red: 252 / 256, green: 0.0, blue: 0.0, alpha: 1.0)
    public var messageColor: UIColor                                    = .init(red: 71 / 256, green: 68 / 256, blue: 69 / 256, alpha: 1.0)
    public var messageFont: UIFont                                      = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 20)
    public var animationDuration: TimeInterval                          = 0.475
    public var loadingIndicatorSize: CGFloat                            = 55
    public var loadingIndicatorInitialTransform: CGAffineTransform      = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 0.12, y: 0.12)
    public var successColor: UIColor                                    = .init(red: 0.0, green: 134 / 256, blue: 245 / 256, alpha: 1.0)
    public var warningColor: UIColor                                    = .init(red: 245 / 256, green: 0.0, blue: 0.0, alpha: 1.0)
    public var backgroundStyle: MessageView.BackgroundStyle             = .dark
}

MessageView.configure(with: MessageViewNightStyleBuilder())
```
